        sum of the 'rRMPolicyMaxRatio' values assigned to all RRMPolicyRatio(s)

        - The attribute rRMPolicyMinRatio defines the minimum resource usage 
        quota for the associated RRMPolicyMemberList, including at least one 
        of prioritized resources and dedicated resources, which means the 
        resources quota that need to be guaranteed for use by the associated

        RRMPolicyRatio(s) name-contained by the same ManagedEntity). The shared 
        resources are not guaranteed for use by the associated 
        rRMPolicyMemberList. The shared resources quota is represented by 
        [rRMPolicyMaxRatio-rRMPolicyMinRatio].
        - Priortized resources: means the resources are preferentially used by 
        the associated RRMPolicyMemberList. These resources are guaranteed for 
        use by the associated RRMPolicyMemberList when it needs to use them. 
        When not used, these resources may be used by other 
        rRMPolicyMemberList(s) (i.e. the rRMPolicyMemberList(s) defined in 
        RRMPolicyRatio(s) name-contained by the same ManagedEntity). 
        The prioritized resources quota is represented by 
        [rRMPolicyMinRatio-rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio]
        - Dedicated resources: means the resources are dedicated for use by 
        the associated RRMPolicyMemberList. These resources can not be shared 
        even if the associated RRMPolicyMember does not use them. The Dedicated 
        resources quota is represented by [rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio].";
